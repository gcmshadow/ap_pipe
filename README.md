# decam_hits

This package contains the Prototype AP Pipeline and will eventually be 
renamed `ap_pipe`.

At present, the main script is `decam_process.py`, which allows a
user to run a portion of the AP Pipeline on data from the DECam HiTS survey.

For more detailed documentation, including a tutorial, 
please see [DMTN-039](https://dmtn-039.lsst.io).
